# ML-Predicts-Views-on-YouTube-Video
I have never had a machine learning class, but I want to learn. This is my first machine learning project. The goal is to learn how to use and compare different ML methods, not necessarily to get the greatest accuracy. 

Goal: Predict the number of views on a youtube video based on various features (duration, bitrate, frame rate, likes, comments)â€¨
I trained and compared:
- Decision trees with and without leaf optimization
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

The accuracy of the methods is measured using mean absolute error. Among all of the methods tested, Random Forest was able to predict the view count with the greatest accuracy.  

I am working on making a stock market predictor next. (Update: I finished it! Check it out in my repositories)
